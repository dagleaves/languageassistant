LanguageAssistant is a large language model (LLM) powered foreign language learning assistant. This harnesses the
language capabilities of LLMs to provide verbal communication capabilities focused on learning foreign languages.

This project is largely a proof of concept, but has been setup to be extensible so that it could be used as a
backend for a full-fledged application utilizing a better UI, microphone recording, transcription, LLM prompts,
and/or multi-lingual text-to-speech.

Features of LanguageAssistant:
- [x] Full real-time vocal multilingual conversations
  - [x] Real-time voice transcription
  - [x] LLM text responses
  - [x] Multilingual text-to-speech
- [x] LLM agent for lesson planning
