LanguageAssistant Documentation
=============================================

| **LanguageAssistant** is a large language model (LLM) powered assistant for learning foreign languages organically.

The goal of LanguageAssistant is to harness the incredible multi-lingual conversation capabilities of modern
chat LLMs using `LangChain <https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain>`_ to provide a seamless language learning
experience comparable to paid professional language tutors.

Whether starting from scratch or looking to hone your language skills through real-world conversations,
LanguageAssistant can help through its real-time transcription (powered by
`OpenAI's Whisper <https://openai.com/research/whisper>`_) and multi-lingual text-to-speech (powered by
`Google TTS <https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech>`_).
